  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>I took this class so I could better learn how to work the internet. As a daughter of a tech man I have a lot to live up to. I hope this class teaches me just that. I would love to be able to call myself a person who knows how to creat a website it would make me sound so smart.</p></html>
